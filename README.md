# osu-map-files
Contains all Ranked and Loved `*.osu` files

Stop updating for a while to remake the structure.

Plans:
- Split repo into multiple branches for Ranked, Loved of each modes.
- Have merged branches for smaller categories (e.g. ranked-all, loved-all, std-only, ...), and an "everythiing" branch.

Old maps can be retrieved by cloning this repo and checking out "rolling-release" branch. (Although it is no longer *rolling* atm.)
